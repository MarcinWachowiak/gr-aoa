id: aoa_autocorrelate
label: Correlate
category: '[AoA]'
documentation: |-
  This block generates a sample correlation matrix for the input vector comprised of values drawn from the receive channels. 
  Args:
  inputs: Number of inputs to the block
  snapshot_size: Determines num. of samples used to compute the sample correlation matrix
  overlap_size: Overlap size between snapshots
  avg_method: Use either standard forward-averaging method or a forward-backward averaging method to compute the sample correlation matrix.

parameters:
- id: snapshot_size
  label: Snapshot Size
  dtype: int
  default: 2048
- id: overlap_size
  label: Overlap Size
  dtype: int
  default: 512
- id: num_inputs
  label: Num Inputs
  dtype: int
  default: 2
- id: avg_method
  label: Averaging Method
  dtype: enum
  options: ['0', '1']
  option_labels: ['Forward', 'Forward-Backward']

asserts:
-  ${num_inputs > 0}
-  ${snapshot_size > 0}
-  ${overlap_size < snapshot_size}

inputs:
- label: in

  dtype: complex
  optional: 0
  multiplicity: ${ num_inputs }
outputs:
- label: out

  dtype: complex
  vlen: ${num_inputs*num_inputs }
  optional: 0

templates:
